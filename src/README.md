# Welcome to Zala's Source Folder

___

Right here we create how Zala does it's work. All builtin libraries are stored in source lib folder. To create your own Zala functions using python, add to the zala lib folder. Otherwise post your code on to Pakrat.

Pakrat's source code is not available here. Check out the Pakrat source code [here](https://repl.it/@TeamZala/Pakrat). For 3rd party library support, Pakrat is not directly implement in source, but as one of the builtin libraries.
