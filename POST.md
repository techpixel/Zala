Hi there! I'm @harperframeinc and my partner is @k9chelesa. We're @TeamZala and we're happy to show you our programming language, Zala.

The idea of Zala is what brought me to repl.it.. I have a very slow computer and terrible storage space. I loved to code, and this dillema wouldn't stop me from doing it.

Then I found repl.it. It's was an easy way to run code from essentially anywhere.

That's what Zala is. It's a programming language designed to be run **on the server**, not off it. It's now possible to run code essentially everywhere. From a smart lamp to large buildings, you can run cloud programs without storing anything.

For Docs please check `README.MD`

Run a test with `python src/zala.py -f tests/(filename).zl`
Run the interpreter with the run button.
