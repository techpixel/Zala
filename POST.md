Hi there! I'm @harperframeinc and my partner is @k9chelesa. We're @TeamZala and we're happy to show you our programming language, Zala.

The idea of Zala is what brought me to repl.it.. I have a very slow computer and terrible storage space. I loved to code, and this dillema wouldn't stop me from doing it.

Then I found repl.it. It's was an easy way to run code from essentially anywhere.

That's what Zala is. It's a programming language designed to be run **on the server**, not off it. It's now possible to run code essentially everywhere. From a smart lamp to large buildings, you can run cloud programs without storing anything.

Some Technical Trade-offs

Good Stuff:
- Well optimized while still being lightweight
- Uses Lark, Pure Python and Fast.
- Easy Extensibility. Put what you want whenever you want.
Bad Stuff:
- Still Slow - It's python after all...
- Poor Errorhandling with imports
Ways to fix:
- Introduce C-Extensions
- Traceback

Roadmap

- Host Pakrat
- Expand Zala with new features such as decorators, lambdas, and magic methods
- Expand Cloud Features - Create libraries to interface with cloud functionality
- Implement LLVMlite compiler technolgy stuff
- Create a actual package manager
